Physics informed NN

Training loss vs validation loss
	Ensure no overfitting

UNet - include cross-fold validation
Bending stiffness -> geometry

Length = 24(t + 2H)
All data points have the same slenderness - length doesn't necessarily matter

Start working on parameters to a image model

If we can't meet next week, send Haifeng an email saying two models are done, working on the third

Check for bending stiffness equation that everyone uses
