# Current status

Two models were established.
1. One from height, width, and angle to predict the stiffness.
2. The other one from stiffness to predict the height, width, and angle.



# Next steps

1. Literature review (AI application in composite material design and modeling) 
What has been done in fiber-based composition, or more specifically,
wood-based composite. -- Sara
2. Model development (make it better and more comprehensive)
Autoencoder-style model,  Physics-informed deep learning. -- Mason
3. Consider an alternative approace in addition to Abaqus. 
4. Optional: Consider add a validation step ising FEA automatically.
So that the last prediction step is always valdiated by FEA or a dataset.
